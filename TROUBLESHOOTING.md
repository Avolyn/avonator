# 🔍 Troubleshooting GitHub Actions

## 🚨 Issue: No Green Checkmarks in GitHub Actions

Let's diagnose what's happening step by step.

## 📋 Step 1: Check if Workflows are Running

1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/Avolyn/avonator
2. **Click "Actions" tab**
3. **Look for these workflows**:
   - "Basic Test" (should be running now)
   - "Simple CI Pipeline" 
   - "CI/CD Pipeline"

## 🔍 Step 2: Check Workflow Status

### **If you see NO workflows at all:**
- GitHub Actions might be disabled
- Go to **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**
- Make sure "Allow all actions and reusable workflows" is selected

### **If you see workflows but they're not running:**
- Check if there are any error messages
- Look for red ❌ or yellow ⚠️ indicators
- Click on the workflow to see details

### **If workflows are running but failing:**
- Click on the failed workflow
- Click on the failed job (red ❌)
- Look at the logs for error messages

## 🛠️ Step 3: Manual Trigger

Let's manually trigger a workflow:

1. **Go to Actions tab**
2. **Click "Basic Test"** workflow
3. **Click "Run workflow"** button (top right)
4. **Select "main" branch**
5. **Click "Run workflow"**

## 📊 Step 4: Check Repository Settings

### **GitHub Actions Settings:**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**
2. Make sure these are enabled:
   - ✅ "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"
   - ✅ "Allow actions created by GitHub"
   - ✅ "Allow actions by Marketplace verified creators"

### **Branch Protection (if any):**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Branches**
2. Check if there are any branch protection rules
3. Make sure they're not blocking workflows

## 🔧 Step 5: Common Issues and Fixes

### **Issue: "Workflow not found"**
- The workflow file might have syntax errors
- Check the YAML syntax in `.github/workflows/`

### **Issue: "Permission denied"**
- Check repository permissions
- Make sure you have write access

### **Issue: "Docker build failed"**
- This is expected if Docker Hub credentials aren't set
- The simple workflows should still pass

### **Issue: "Python tests failed"**
- Check if the test files exist
- Verify Python dependencies

## 🎯 Step 6: Expected Results

### **"Basic Test" workflow should show:**
```
🚀 Starting basic test...
Current directory: /home/runner/work/avonator/avonator
Files in directory:
[list of files]
✅ Basic test completed successfully!
```

### **"Simple CI Pipeline" should show:**
- Python Tests: ✅ success
- Docker Test: ✅ success  
- Secret Verification: ✅ success

## 🆘 Step 7: If Still Not Working

### **Check GitHub Status:**
- Go to https://www.githubstatus.com/
- Make sure GitHub Actions is operational

### **Check Repository Permissions:**
- Make sure you're the owner or have admin access
- Check if there are any organization restrictions

### **Try a Different Approach:**
- Create a new branch: `git checkout -b test-workflow`
- Make a small change and push
- See if workflows run on the new branch

## 📞 What to Tell Me

Please check the above steps and tell me:

1. **Do you see any workflows in the Actions tab?**
2. **If yes, what status do they show?** (running, failed, success)
3. **If failed, what error messages do you see?**
4. **Can you manually trigger the "Basic Test" workflow?**

This will help me identify exactly what's preventing the workflows from running successfully.

## 🚀 Quick Fix Attempt

Let me also create an even simpler workflow that should definitely work:

```yaml
name: Ultra Simple Test
on: [push, workflow_dispatch]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - run: echo "Hello World! This should work!"
```

This ultra-simple workflow should show a green checkmark if GitHub Actions is working at all.
